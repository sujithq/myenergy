## 🧮 ROI Calculation Logic

### **Cost Scenarios:**

1. **Baseline (No Solar, No Battery)**
   ```
   Cost = TotalConsumption × ImportPrice
   ```

2. **With Solar Only**
   ```
   GridImport = max(0, Consumption - Production)
   GridExport = max(0, Production - Consumption)
   Cost = (GridImport × ImportPrice) - (GridExport × ExportPrice)
   ```

3. **With Solar + Battery**
   ```
   Uses BatterySimulationService for smart optimization
   Cost = Simulation result with battery
   ```

### **Savings Calculation:**

```
SolarDailySavings = BaselineCost - CostWithSolar
BatterySavings = CostWithSolar - CostWithSolarAndBattery
TotalDailySavings = BaselineCost - CostWithSolarAndBattery
```

### **Net Position:**

```
SolarNetPosition = CumulativeSolarSavings - SolarInvestmentCost
BatteryNetPosition = CumulativeBatterySavings - BatteryInvestmentCost
CombinedNetPosition = TotalCumulativeSavings - TotalInvestment
```

### **Break-Even Detection:**

Break-even occurs when `Net Position >= 0` for the first time.

### **Payback Period:**

```
PaybackMonths = ((BreakEvenYear - InstallYear) × 12) 
                + BreakEvenMonth - InstallMonth
```

## 🎯 Key Metrics Explained

### **Net Position**
```
Net Position = Cumulative Savings - Investment Cost
```
- **Negative**: Still paying off investment
- **Zero**: Break-even point
- **Positive**: Investment is profitable

### **Payback Period**
```
Payback Period = Time from installation to break-even
```
- Typical solar: 5-10 years
- Typical battery: 7-12 years
- Combined: Depends on local electricity prices

### **ROI Percentage**
```
ROI % = (Total Savings / Total Investment) × 100
```
- After 1 year: Usually 10-15%
- At break-even: 100%
- After 20 years: 300-500%

### **Annual Savings Rate**
```
Annual Rate = (Annual Savings / Investment) × 100
```
- Indicates investment efficiency
- Higher rate = faster payback
- Typical: 10-20% per year

## 🔧 Configuration Tips

### **Accurate Installation Dates:**
- Use actual installation date, not purchase date
- Solar date = first production date
- Battery date = first charge date
- Affects break-even calculation significantly

### **Investment Costs:**
- Include **total** cost (equipment + installation + permits)
- Don't forget:
  - Inverter
  - Wiring
  - Monitoring system
  - Grid connection fees
  - Permits and inspections

### **Pricing Strategy:**
- **Fixed Pricing**: Simpler, predictable
- **Dynamic (ODS)**: More accurate for variable tariffs
- Test both to see impact on ROI

### **Analysis Period:**
- **Short term** (1 year): Shows seasonal patterns
- **Medium term** (2-5 years): See break-even approach
- **Long term** (5+ years): Full investment lifecycle
